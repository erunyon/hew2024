      <p><strong>BUTTERCUP:</strong> Farm boy. Polish my horse's saddle. I want to see my face shining in it by morning.</p>
      <p><strong>WESTLEY:</strong> <em>(quietly, watching her)</em> As you wish.</p>
      <p>Westley is perhaps half a dozen years older than Buttercup. And maybe as handsome as she is beautiful. He gazes at her as she walks away.</p>
      <p><strong>GRANDFATHER:</strong> <em>(off-screen)</em> "As you wish" was all he ever said to her.</p>
      <p><em>DISSOLVE TO:</em></p>
      <p>WESTLEY, outside, chopping wood. Buttercup drops two large buckets near him.</p>
      <p><strong>BUTTERCUP:</strong> Farm Boy. Fill these with water -- <em>(a beat)</em> --please.</p>
      <p><strong>WESTLEY:</strong> As you wish.</p>
      <p>She leaves; his eyes stay on her. She stops, turns -- he manages to look away as now her eyes stay on him.</p>
      <p><strong>GRANDFATHER:</strong> <em>(off-screen)</em> That day, she was amazed to discover that when he was saying, "As you wish," what he meant was, "I love you."</p>
      <p><em>DISSOLVE TO:</em></p>
      <p><strong>BUTTERCUP IN THE KITCHEN - DUSK</strong></p>
      <p>Westley enters with an armload of firewood.</p>
      <p><strong>GRANDFATHER:</strong> <em>(off-screen)</em> And even more amazing was the day she realized she truly loved him back.</p>
      <p><strong>BUTTERCUP:</strong> <em>(pointing to a pitcher that she could reach herself)</em> Farm Boy, fetch me that pitcher.</p>
      <p>He gets it, hands it to her; they are standing very close to each other gazing into each other's eyes.</p>
      <p><strong>WESTLEY:</strong> As you wish.</p>
      <p>Now he turns, moves outside.</p>
      <p><em>DISSOLVE TO:</em></p>
      <p>WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP, outside his tiny hovel in the red glow of sunset. They are locked in a passionate kiss.</p>
      <p><strong>THE KID:</strong> <em>(off-screen)</em> -hold it, hold it-</p>
      <p><em>CUT TO:</em></p>
      <p><strong>THE KID'S ROOM</strong></p>
      <p><strong>THE KID:</strong> What is this? Are you trying to trick me? -- Where's the sports? -- Is this a kissing book?</p>
      <p><strong>GRANDFATHER:</strong> -- wait, just wait --</p>
      <p><strong>THE KID:</strong> -- well, when does it get good?</p>
      <p><strong>GRANDFATHER:</strong> Keep your shirt on. Let me read. <em>(reading again)</em> Westley had no money for marriage. So he packed his few belongings and left the farm to seek his fortune across the sea.</p>
